# pokemon-of-the-day

This mobile app was developed for study purposes using Android Studio. 

It uses the [Pokémon api](https://pokeapi.co/) to retrieve some Pokémon information and load their images via url.<br>
I also used icons from these websites:
<ul>
  <li>https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/pokemon</li>
  <li>https://icon-icons.com/search/icons/pokemon</li>
  <li>https://icons8.com/icons/set/pokemon</li>
</ul>

You can see how the app works in this [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/JdK3SRkqdYE).
